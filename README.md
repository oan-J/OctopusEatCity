# OctopusEatCity

## Game Overview

In this game, the player controls an octopus exploring a city. The main objective is to grow by consuming various objects in the urban environment, such as cars and street lamps. A background coin sound effect indicates successful consumption while navigating through the vibrant cityscape.

P.S. Only part of the objects can be consumed.

P.P.S. This is not a complete game as I only had access to Quest 2 for 4 days.
